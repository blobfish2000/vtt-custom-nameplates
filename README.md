A module for FoundryVTT which allows you to customize token, template, and ruler nameplates

## Instructions
In the module settings you can find the Edit Global Configuration button.
- Global configurations will apply to all scenes if they do not have a Local configuration
- Scene specific configurations, or Local configurations, will overeride the global configuration for the current viewed scene

## Future

1. Token specific configurations (e.g enemies, friendlies)
2. ~~Scene specific configurations?~~ Now in v1.0.1!
3. ~~Measured template and Ruler configuration~~ Now in v1.0.1!
